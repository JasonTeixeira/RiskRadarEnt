## System Overview

RiskRadar Enterprise is a production-grade, institutional portfolio risk management platform designed for high-frequency trading firms, hedge funds, and investment banks. The system provides real-time risk calculations, stress testing, Monte Carlo simulations, and comprehensive portfolio analytics with sub-second latency.

### Key Capabilities
- **Real-time Risk Analytics**: Calculate 17+ risk metrics in under 250ms
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Isolated tenant data with row-level security
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Auto-scaling based on computation load
- **High Availability**: 99.99% uptime SLA with zero-downtime deployments
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Asynchronous task processing with Celery
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, tracing, and alerting

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Bounded contexts for risk calculation, portfolio management, and market data
- Rich domain models with business logic encapsulation
- Aggregate roots for consistency boundaries

### 2. Microservices Architecture
- Loosely coupled services communicating via REST APIs and message queues
- Service mesh for inter-service communication
- Independent deployment and scaling

### 3. Event Sourcing & CQRS
- Event store for audit trail and temporal queries
- Separate read and write models for optimization
- Event-driven state changes

### 4. Security by Design
- Zero-trust network architecture
- End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Multi-factor authentication and fine-grained authorization

### 5. Cloud-Native Design
- Container-first deployment strategy
- Kubernetes orchestration for container management
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform

tm ..> green_api: 0% traffic

note right of tm
  Deployment Steps:
  1. Deploy green environment
